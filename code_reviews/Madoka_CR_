Sprint 2


Maintainability:

Code to be reviewed:KeyboardController.cs
Author of code: Xing Wu

Implements brief comment and on each methods and what it does helps readers understand the methods quickers.

There are two linkAttack under the KeyController Constructor.You will only need one linkAttack instatniation.
The instantiated 

 The linkItem2 instatntiation seems to 
 linkEquipItem2 = new LinkEquipItem1();
 linkEquipItem2 = new LinkEquipItem2();

As an organization and maitainablity, the intantiation can be moved to another class.
Not a bad idea to have the logic in one class and the initialization in another, if possible. 
Implement commands rather than method names

As for grouping, try to only add in Controllers in the controller folders and link class with the link classes.
There may have been issues with communication witht naming with the commands, but alter the name to 
the current command names, or have Command classes to be changed to what you have. 



Readiblity:

Code to be reviewed:MouseController.cs
Author of code: Xing Wu

There are still implmentation logics that will still need to be done. There are comments that help
understand that this should be done.
There aren't much to really read in this since, the logics aren't completed. 
If this was the case, if you have any ideas in methods, it you can also jot done brief ideas for structure purpuses.
