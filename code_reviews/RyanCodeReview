Notes: The structure is written very simple, yet effectively. Everything is appropriately named and is self-contained. There are no immediate errors on
       readabilirty, although more comments could be useful to describe the methods.

Notes: I believe the current file is fairly maintainable, especially with the .Sprite..() functions.  It should allow for pretty convenient addition of 
       sprites, assuming this is they all share those functions.  If not, this may create issues in that those sprites don't have corresponding states.
Way to change?: If this becomes an issue, I'd recommend splitting the finer details of the factory into smaller factories, so there is one for 
                Link, the enemies, etc.
