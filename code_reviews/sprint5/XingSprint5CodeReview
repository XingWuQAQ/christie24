Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	Everything is well-spaced and I like how almost there are basic comments explaining what it is.
	However, I did notice that there are places with much bigger spaces than others. It doesn't affect its readibility though.

Specific comments on code quality:
	There are some code commented out that can be deleted if not needed anymore.
	However, everything seems alright in terms of code quality.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to the file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
	It might be good practice to declare variables such as addBomb and addRupee as a static private set for future possible changes. However, In our case, since this would be the last sprint, it is not needed. 
	However, it would be relatively easy to change if we ever hypothetically needed to change the ammount of bombs and rupees are picked up.
