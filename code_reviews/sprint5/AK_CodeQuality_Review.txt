+ Each object has a separate load method for increased efficiency
- If/Else would be better than switch cases for equiping items since there are only 2 possibilities

Hypothetical Change: A lot of methods have both an A and B variant with almost identical code. It would make more sense to just have a check
for which slot to use.
