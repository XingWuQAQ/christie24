----READABILITY----
Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
  DungeonFishBlock.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
  Madoka Kamishima
Number of minutes taken to complete the review:
  5 minutes
Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
  Overall, it seems rather easy to read. However, there are weird spaces throughout.
  There aren't a lot of comments, but the content itself is pretty self-explanatory so that's fine.
  
----CODE QUALITY----
Name of the .cs file being reviewed:
  PreviousBlockCommand.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed:
  Madoka Kamishima
Specific comments on code quality:
  I don't think these are necessarily needed:
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Text;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
  In a hypothetical situation where there is a special effect added to the blocks, 
  for example, transitioning from a light block, damage from attack, and to a broken block, 
  i think it would be relatively simple to incorporate since the code is pretty simple and straightforward
