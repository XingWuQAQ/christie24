Code Quality:

*Change the name Object.cs to something more detailed since  classes in OOP is an interitence of a class from OOP class Object (for future code error when we call Object). 

* watch out with  the name error in List. Most says List<Object>, but there are a few that says List<Objects>.
If these are two different list names, change the names so it is more distiguishable.

* If else state when checking  what objects they are seem to be tightly coupled. Maybe separate these into own method.

Readiblility:


Minutes spent reading: 1-2 minutes

*The code is short and easy to read. The comments for the functions help out with understanding what the functions are doing much quicker. 
The names of the variables helped out with understanding the functions of the code. If I had to be very stingy, then it would be the position of the comments. 
For the future code, if there were to be more comments and codes, having the postiion of the comments the same for most comments would be quicker to identify.
