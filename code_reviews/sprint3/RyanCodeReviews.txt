I believe your code is very readable. The comments are good at guiding the reader through the code and your methods are split up well as to keep their
structure simple. My only critiques are with the alignment of some of the text.  The comments being in the middle are a little jarring and some of your methods and 
brackets do not line up.

Your code does a good job at separating the responsibilities of each method. The main concerns aer with the use of switch cases and the delegates. 
If it is possible, try and find a way to make the switch cases into a function and make a dictionary of (String,Delegate). It also appears all of your 
Impact methods could be turned into one with the generic type IItem in the parameter instead of the specific type.
I must also question what the CollisionDetector.CollisionType collisionType parameter does in your methods. It does not appear to do anything since 
the only method call uses the item's object.
