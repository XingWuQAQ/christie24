Although the code is still in the process of finishing, it seems to be at a good start.

The method names are well written.It is easy to see what each methods will be doing. 

One note: I did this too, but change the number add variables to 2, as magic number is not allowed.

Comment helps with what is unfinished. 

*I guess the in the use if the if statements, we can create method to add for the obj.isxxxx in addObject method for less redundancy. 
It is readable and easy follow along.
Each method names are short but well described on what they do. 

Overall the code looks pretty good in my end.
