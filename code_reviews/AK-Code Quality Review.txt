GroundItemSystem.cs - Ugonna Obiagwu

Code Quality:
- Separate ISprite variable for every single item seems far too inefficient
- Load methods all add the item to the theseGroundItems list, but it could probably be done in a more efficient manner

Suggestions for fixing it:
- Create a list of ISprite objects instead ofa separate instance variable for each one.
Making this adjustment could also allow you to consolodate all of the load methods into a
single methods, allowing for a much more efficient class.
