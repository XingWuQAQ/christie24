Specific comments on code quality:
There isn't much for me to critique, however, I have included a few notes below:
- TotalFrame could definitely be a const since it doesn't change (shouldn't change).
- In terms of maintainability, since it is relatively simple, I don't think it would be complicated to change in the future.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
Since this is relatively simple code made for a VERY specific purpose (for this sprint), it may seem like it might not support future changes. 
However, it should actually be relatively easy to transform the block into doing other functions (such as twirling), since the 
code is relatively direct.
