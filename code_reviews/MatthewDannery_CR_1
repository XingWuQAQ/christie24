Specific comments on code quality
Lots of lines for drawing textures, unique values for each method that depend on the sprite sheet. Does not seem easily maintainable as scale grows. Code also could use more comments.
Hard to parse through the code than with.

Specific comments on code quality
Separate methods for Link states in each direction and each direction attacking. Methods are too spread out with this design, would be more design efficient to use an object to simplfy
calls. Could be redesigned or implement a sprite factory to make maintainable and decrease technical debt.
